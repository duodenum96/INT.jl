# Practice

In the practice section we will build the basic knowledge for timescale estimation. We'll start with 
building up the autocorrelation function (ACF) and how it relates to INTs.  Then 
we'll move on to more advanced concepts such as linking the ACF to the power spectrum. 
If you are familiar with INTs, you can directly 
jump to the section [Using IntrinsicTimescales.jl for Timescale Estimation-1: Model-Free Methods] and [2- Simulation-Based Methods]. If you are just starting or you want to brush up on the fundamentals, be my guest.
