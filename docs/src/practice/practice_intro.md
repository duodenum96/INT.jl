# Practice

In the practice section we will build the basic knowledge for timescale estimation. We'll start with building up the autocorrelation function (ACF) and how it relates to INTs.  Then we'll move on to more advanced concepts such as linking the ACF to the power spectrum. If you are familiar with INTs, you can directly jump to the section [Model-Free Timescale Estimation](../acw.md) and [Simulation Based Timescale Estimation](../simbasedinference.md). If you are just starting or you want to brush up on the fundamentals, be my guest.
